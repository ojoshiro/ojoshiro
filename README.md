- 👋 Hi, I’m @ojoshiro. No, Ojoshiro. I'm not 'at' ojoshiro. Names already HAD an indicator. They start with a capital... Don't reinvent the wheel.
- 👀 I’m interested in creating beautiful things, figuring out how things work and finding a way to make more of the time I have.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Discord.botisms, Arduino Sketches, Turning a raspberry pi into a doorbitch (VPN, PiHole, NAS, GitHome) and how to be nice.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on World Domination, SARS-Covid 2022 (The strain that attacks press and politicians first) and development of Real Intelligence (Naming yourself "sapiens" doesn't make it so).
- 📫 You can try yelling my name. You could open a church and hope praying to me helps (about as likely as praying to anything else helps). You could try luring me with food. Chances that sending an email to <ojoshiro@gmail.com> works are about as slim as Linux running without commandline.
